The latter includes oversight bodies with investigative powers and internal affairs departments as well as specific devices such as early warning indicators, professional reporting mechanisms and integrity tests.

Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation\'s highest office. Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune\'s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden. A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective--the story of one man\'s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of \"hope and change,\" and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama\'s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day.</li></ul>', 'uploads/files/649290a0b1193a-promised-land-pdf', '2023-06-21 07:54:40', '2023-06-21 08:56:58', 1, 1001),

Herminia Ibarra-renowned leadership expert at London Business School-shows how individuals at all levels can step up to leadership by making small but crucial changes in their jobs, their networks, and themselves. In Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader, Ibarra offers advice to: Redefine your job in order to make more-strategic contributions; diversify your network so that you connect to, and learn from, a wider range of stakeholders; and become more playful with your self-concept, allowing your familiar (and possibly outdated) leadership style to evolve. Ibarra turns the usual leadership advice-to generate insight about yourself through reflection and analysis of your strengths and weaknesses-on its head by arguing that you must first act and experiment your way into trying new things. The valuable external perspective you gain from direct experiences and experimentation, which Ibarra calls \"outsight,\" provides new and critical information on what kind of work is important to you, how you should invest your time, why and which relationships matter, and, ultimately, who you want to become.

Part I discusses basic business organization and management subjects applicable to those who desire to be a successful business owner. It covers material for those just starting a business as well as provides information that is of value to those who want to better organize and manage their current business. Part II discusses basic investigative skills applicable to all levels of experiences and areas of personal interest.

In this respect, being a lawyer involves being able to reason like a lawyer, even more than having detailed knowledge of particular sets of rules. Introduction to Law reflects this view by focusing on the functions of rules and on ways of arguing the relative qualities of alternative legal solutions. Where ‘positive’ law is discussed, the emphasis is on the legal questions that must be addressed by a field of law and on the different solutions which have been adopted by, for instance, the common law and civil law tradition.

The money laundering and terrorist financing threat in the sector not only results from direct penetration of criminals into operations of money remittance or currency exchange providers. The absence or lax implementation of AML/CFT standards and adequate related policies provide opportunities which are being exploited by money launderers and other criminals.</p><p>Finally, the report maps also a number of issues and areas which were identified in this context as appearing to require additional efforts, both from regulatory and supervisory authorities as well as from the industry, in order to reduce the misuse of the sector and ensure that ML/TF risks are adequately addressed.&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/files/64ae4e9f5d417Money-laundering-through-money-remittance-and-currency-exchange-providers---PDFDrive----1--pdf', '2023-07-12 08:56:31', NULL, 1, 1001),

In a sense, the economics of risk is a difficult subject: it involves understanding human decisions in the absence of perfect information. How do we make decisions when we do not know some of events affecting us? The complexities of our uncertain world and of how humans obtain and process information make this difficult. In spite of these difficulties, much progress has been made. First, probability theory is the corner stone of risk assessment. This allows us to measure risk in a fashion that can be communicated among decision makers or researchers. Second, risk preferences are now better understood. This provides useful insights into the economic rationality of decision making under uncertainty. Third, over the last decades, good insights have been developed about the value of information. This helps better understand the role of information in human decision making and this book provides a systematic treatment of these issues in the context of both private and public decisions under uncertainty.</p><ul><li>Balanced treatment of conceptual models and applied analysis</li><li>Considers both private and public decisions under uncertainty</li><li>Website presents application exercises in Excel</li></ul>', 'uploads/files/64af7c0936a90risk-analysis-in-theory-and-practice-pdf', '2023-07-13 06:22:33', NULL, 1, 1001),

It argues that public interest is defined in opposition to corporate powers and its core content identified by the rights that are all-purposive for the distribution of social benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A crucial part of the proposal is dedicated to the impact of security policies and government secrecy on civil liberties. It argues that unrestrained secrecy limits the epistemic entitlement of citizens to know under which conditions their rights are limited by security policies and corporate interests. When citizens are denied the right to assess when these policies are prejudicial to their freedoms, whistleblowing represents a legitimate form of political agency that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens against the threat of unrestrained secrecy by government power.</p><p>Finally, the book contributes to shifting the attention of democratic theory from the procedures of consent formation to the mechanisms that guarantee the expression of dissent. It argues that whistleblowing is a distinctive form of civil dissent that contributes to the demands of institutional transparency in constitutional democracies and explores the idea that the way institutions are responsive to dissent determines the robustness of democracy, and ultimately, its legitimacy. What place dissenters have within a society, whether they enjoy personal safety, legal protection, and safe channels for their disclosure, are hallmarks of a good democracy, and of its sense of justice.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Intro;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Preface;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Acknowledgments;</strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 1: Introduction;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1.1 The Political Context of&nbsp;Whistleblowing Disclosures;&nbsp;</p><p>1.2 A Theory of&nbsp;Whistleblowing;&nbsp;</p><p>1.3 Plan of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Book; References;</p><p><strong>Chapter 2: What Is Whistleblowing?;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2.1 The Legacy of&nbsp;Whistleblowers;&nbsp;</p><p>2.2 Parrhesia;</p><p>&nbsp;2.3 Publicity;&nbsp;</p><p>2.4 The Current State of&nbsp;Whistleblowing Theory;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;The Moral Choice View;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;The Standard Theory;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Complicity;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Integrity;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Whistleblowing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Civic Duty;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Good Faith and&nbsp;Loyalty;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>2.5 A Definition of&nbsp;Whistleblowing;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;A Definition;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Constitutive Elements</li><li>&nbsp;Civic and&nbsp;Political Whistleblowing</li><li>&nbsp;What Whistleblowing Is Not;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>2.6 Concluding Remarks; References;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chapter 3: Public Interest and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Threat of&nbsp; Corruption: A&nbsp;Case for&nbsp;Civic Whistleblowing;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>3.1 Political Corruption;&nbsp;</p><p>3.2 The Public Interest;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Non-competing Interests;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;The Common Good;</li><li>&nbsp;Deliberative Accounts;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Proceduralist Accounts;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Epistemic Objections;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>3.3 A Presumptive Interest for&nbsp;All-Purposive Rights;&nbsp;</p><p>3.3.1 The Public;&nbsp;</p><p>3.3.2 The Nature of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Interest;&nbsp;</p><p>3.4 The Role of&nbsp;Civic Whistleblowers;&nbsp;</p><p>3.5 Concluding Remarks; References<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chapter 4: The Threat of&nbsp;Secrecy</strong></p><p>4.1 Liberty and&nbsp;Security: Lessons from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Classics;&nbsp;</p><p>4.2 Striking the&nbsp;Balance?;&nbsp;</p><p>4.3 The Threat from&nbsp;Secrecy;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Secrecy: A&nbsp;Conceptual Analysis;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Individual and&nbsp;Institutional Secrecy;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>4.4 A Democratic Justification of&nbsp;Secrecy?;</p><p>&nbsp;4.5 Pitfalls of&nbsp;State Secrecy Justifications;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Abuse of&nbsp;Information;</li><li>&nbsp; Deception;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Quality of&nbsp;Deliberation;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Deference to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Executive;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>4.6 Secrecy and&nbsp;Civil Liberties;&nbsp;</p><p>4.7 An Epistemic Framework for&nbsp;Liberty and&nbsp;Security;&nbsp;</p><p>4.8 Concluding Remarks; References;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chapter 5: A Justification of&nbsp;Political Whistleblowing</strong></p><p>5.1 The Case for&nbsp;Political Whistleblowing</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Breach of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Obligation;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Breach of&nbsp;Trust;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;It is Unpatriotic;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Harm to&nbsp;National Security;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Vigilantism;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Accountability;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Imperfect Information;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>5.2 When Is Whistleblowing Justified?;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;The Informational Circumstances of&nbsp;Whistleblowing Disclosures;</li><li>&nbsp;Communicative Constraints;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Intent;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Disclosures in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Public Interest;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>5.3 Concluding Remarks; References;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chapter 6: Charting Dissent: Whistleblowing, Civil Disobedience, and&nbsp;Conscientious Objection</strong></p><p>6.1 Is Whistleblowing a&nbsp;Form of&nbsp;Dissent, After All?</p><p>6.2 Conscientious Objection;&nbsp;</p><p>6.3 Civil Disobedience;&nbsp;</p><p>6.4 Whistleblowing as&nbsp;Civil Dissent;&nbsp;</p><p>6.5 Concluding Remarks; References;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chapter 7: Conclusion;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>7.1 Whistleblower Protection as&nbsp;a&nbsp;State Duty;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reference;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Index</strong></p>', 'uploads/files/64af7f0a69a37Speaking-Truth-to-Power---A-Theory-of-Whistleblowing---PDFDrive---pdf', '2023-07-13 06:35:22', NULL, 1, 1001),

When police killings of citizens go unpunished, political torture is sanctioned by the state, and the financial frauds of Wall Street traders remain unprosecuted, nothing succeeds with such regularity as the active failures of national states to obstruct the crimes of the powerful.</p><p>Written from the perspective of global sustainability and as an unflinching and unforgiving exposé of the full range of the crimes of the powerful, <i>Unchecked Corporate Power</i> reveals how legalized authorities and political institutions charged with the duty of protecting citizens from law-breaking and injurious activities have increasingly become enablers and colluders with the very enterprises they are obliged to regulate. Here, Gregg Barak explains why the United States and other countries are duplicitous in their harsh reactions to street crimes in comparison to the significantly more harmful and far-reaching crimes of the powerful, and why the crimes of the powerful are treated as beyond incrimination.</p><p>What happens to nations that surrender ever-growing economic and political power to the globally super rich and the mammoth multinational corporations they control? And what can people from around the world do to resist the criminality and victimization perpetrated by multinationals, and generated by the prevailing global political economy? Barak examines an array of multinational crimes—corporate, environmental, financial, and state—and their state-legal responses, and outlines policies and strategies for revolutionizing these contradictory relations of capital reproduction, criminality, and unsustainability.</p><p>Table Of Content :</p><p><i>reface</i></p><p><strong>Part I: Routinizing&nbsp;the Crimes&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Powerful</strong></p><p>Introduction: On the State Routinization of Unchecked Corporate Power</p><p>1.

What is particularly needed is leadership with ethical or moral behavior ingrained in its values system. People know that when they are not treated ethically and morally, bad things happen. They recognize that when crime or unethical acts are chosen, stable and productive lives are damaged and environments become destructive. They, therefore, prefer an environment where their lives proceed in constructive ways to improve the quality of life for themselves and others. In view of this, intentional immoral and unethical behavior for short-term gains should be identified and prevented from sowing seeds of destruction.</p><p>The authors believe that the purpose of moral leadership is to increase the quality of life for humanity by eliminating the huge tragic costs and wastes that inevitably results from immoral or unethical leadership. To evaluate and compare existing moral leadership with desired standards, they proposed the use of Values Analysis as the methodological tool powered by the Ideas Unlimited Group Survey Method which is able to penetrate the complexities Values Analysis presents.</p><p>Ethical and moral leadership is still the most critical variable that leaders must have to influence organizational behavior and performance. Quality cannot be achieved or sustained in an immoral, corrupt or dishonest system. The need for moral leadership will continue to increase with the ever increasing human and material costs of its failure. Hence, the onus is on leaders to take an active role in promoting positive values and practices in their organizations and communities.</p><p>A good way to teach moral leadership is via the Benefit-Cost Method by providing some examples of all the good that can occur when individuals or groups have high moral and ethical standards and contrast these with the destructiveness and misery which result from opposite cases. There may be no more important subject for teachers and students than the pursuit of the vision to achieve universal moral leadership.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><ol><li>Theory and Purpose for Moral Leadership</li><li>Moral Leadership through the Ages</li><li>Values Analysis for Moral Leadership</li><li>When Moral Leadership Fails</li><li>Building Your Personal Foundation for Moral Leadership</li><li>Humankind’s Future and Moral Leadership</li><li>Guidelines for Teachers</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>', 'uploads/files/64c736caf25favalues-analysis-for-moral-leadership-pdf', '2023-07-31 06:21:30', NULL, 1, 1001),

The truth is, there\'s no such thing as a personality \"type\", or a \"real you\" that can only be unearthed through some process of self-discovery. Instead, your personality is something you can intentionally choose and create. Rather than being defined by the past and trapped in unresolved traumas, you can build your identity and internal narrative to serve the future you desire. In Personality Isn\'t Permanent, Dr. Hardy draws on psychological research to demolish the popular misconception that personality-a person\'s consistent attitudes and behaviors-is innate and unchanging. He offers practical, motivational advice to help you cultivate the traits and achieve the goals you always dreamed of. In Personality Isn\'t Permanent, you\'ll learn: · Why you should never be the \"former anything\". Defining yourself by your past successes can be just as damaging to your potential to grow as being haunted by past failures. · How to flip the script on negative memories and view them as something that happened for you, not to you. · How to design a desired vision of your \"future self,\" and make decisions based on what \"they\" would want. · How to tap into what psychologists\' call \"pull motivation\" by narrowing your focus on a single, definable, and compelling outcome. · Why you should consistently put yourself in new situations that can initially be emotionally uncomfortable. · Why you should measure your progress by how much you\'ve grown, rather than what you lack. Along the way, you\'ll hear fascinating true stories of radical self-transformation, like Vanessa O\'Brien, who quit her corporate job and went on to obtain Guinness World Records for climbing the tallest mountains in the world; Andre Norman, who became a Harvard fellow after serving a fourteen-year prison sentence; Ken Arlen, who instantly quit smoking by changing his backstory; and Hardy himself, who transcended his childhood in a broken home, surrounded by issues of addiction and mental illness, to get his PhD and build a happy family. Filled with scientific strategies for reframing your past and designing your future, Personality Isn\'t Permanent is your practical guide to transcending your limitations and becoming the person you always wanted to be\"--</p>', 'uploads/files/64c759175f86bpersonality-isn-y-pdf', '2023-07-31 08:47:51', NULL, 1, 1001),

This process, which forces students to think and talk in radically new and different ways about conflicts, is directed by professors in the course of their lectures and examinations, and conducted via spoken and written language. Beth Mertz\'s book is the first study to truly delve into that language to reveal the complexities of how this process takes place. Mertz bases her linguistic study on tape recordings from her first year Contracts courses in eight different law schools. She knows how all these schools employ the Socratic method between teacher and student, forcing the student to shift away from moral and emotional terms in thinking about conflict, toward frameworks of legal authority instead. This move away from moral frameworks is key, she says, arguing that it represents an underlying world view at the core not just of law education, but for better or worse, of the entire US legal system - which, while providing a useful source of legitimacy and a means to process conflict, fails to deal systematically with aspects of fairness and social justice. The latter part of her study shows how differences in race and gender makeup among law students and professors can subtly alter this process. Written within the tradition of anthropological lingustics, Mertz\'s work - the first to study law school in this sort of detail - will appeal to a wide spectrum of readers interested in the intersection of law, language, and society: sociolinguists; anthropologists; feminist, race, and social theorists, and law professors.</p>', 'uploads/files/64c75aac1c224Learning-to-“Think-Like-a-Lawyer”---PDFDrive----1--pdf', '2023-07-31 08:54:36', NULL, 1, 1001),

Ravenelle shares the personal stories of nearly eighty predominantly millennial workers from Airbnb, Uber, TaskRabbit, and Kitchensurfing. Their stories underline the volatility of working in the gig economy: the autonomy these young workers expected has been usurped by the need to maintain algorithm-approved acceptance and response rates. The sharing economy upends generations of workplace protections such as worker safety; workplace protections around discrimination and sexual harassment; the right to unionize; and the right to redress for injuries. Discerning three types of gig economy workers—Success Stories, who have used the gig economy to create the life they want; Strugglers, who can’t make ends meet; and Strivers, who have stable jobs and use the sharing economy for extra cash—Ravenelle examines the costs, benefits, and societal impact of this new economic movement.

Football, Gambling, and Money Laundering describes in impressive detail the scope of the problem, the layers of denial that allow sports-related financial crime to flourish, and the steps that are being taken--and that need to be taken--to combat illicit operations in the sports world. Expert analysis explains criminal activity in the context of football, and how sports governing bodies, the media, and others have created a culture that regularly turns a blind eye. International data and instructive legal case examples shed light on the role of the Internet in the spread of gambling and money laundering as well as the strengths and weaknesses of current law enforcement, legislative, and sports-based efforts in fighting corruption. Included in the coverage: • Criminal activity in the sports world • Financial crime and exploitation in football and gambling • Legal wagering and illegal betting, including online • Illegal and disguised payment instruments used by organized crime • International legal cooperation in combating money laundering • National and international proposals for improving the sports and gambling industries to prevent money laundering An authoritative reference to a growing and wide-reaching concern, Football, Gambling, and Money Laundering will find an interested audience among academics, prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officials, and others involved in efforts to curb corruption and money laundering in the world of football.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Frontmatter</li><li>1.

And individuals who communicate effectively are frequently rewarded in the workplace with promotions and advancements. Usually when people think about communication we describe it as how individuals relate to one another using a common set of signs and symbols to share feelings, ideas, and thoughts with one another. However, communication isn’t only about sharing information; it’s about creating appropriate messages via different communication channels to obtain shared understanding among interacting people. Communication is a complicated human activity and to be an effective communicator, knowledge about the communication process, skills for interacting with others and understanding the different rules that guide human interactions in various environments is required. Therefore, to master the skills employers want in their workforce, individuals must carefully think about different factors that affect the communication process and the likelihood of success in each interaction – especially as it occurs in the workplace.</p><p>The ability to communicate effectively in the workplace is essential for your personal and professional success. Over your career you will have a number of opportunities to participate in organizational communication exchanges. Some conversations will occur in business meetings, corporate presentations, departmental/unit gatherings, and email messages among various other communication and technology-based activities. Each interaction creates an opportunity for you to enhance or diminish the impression or professional image you wish to leave on others. Although there are a variety of different types of business communication (e.g., business writing, managerial communication, or presentation development), this text focuses on helping you to become a competent communicator when communicating digitally in professional contexts. Consequently, email, voicemail, video chat and social media, as digital forms of workplace communication, will be explored in relation to the theories of communication competency, impression management and personal branding.</p><p>Therefore the purpose of this book is to:</p><p>Acquaint you with the theory of communication competency and what it means to be a competent communicator in a digital environment</p><p>Familiarize you with the communication process as well as the elements and forms of communication occurring in professional settings</p><p>Introduce you to criteria for communicating effectively in digital workplace environments and contexts</p><p>Provide you with tips and best practices for communicating competently in the workplace when using digital channels such as voicemail, email, video chat, and social media.\'</p>', 'uploads/files/64c8a4f3dcb17communicating-with-technology-pdf', '2023-08-01 08:23:47', NULL, 1, 1001),

The central position of the book is that the declared goals underlying the criminalization of money laundering have not been fulfilled. The effectiveness of the anti-money laundering regime in Germany is assessed by examining the indirect effects, collateral consequences, and positive interpretations of the law in action and of the law inaction; reducing the issue to a question of symbolic effectiveness does not reflect the complexity of the matter. What is demonstrated, is that the goals attributed to the regime were too ambitious, and that a lower degree of effectiveness has been accepted in order to balance the inherent political, economic and financial conflicting interests. Unlike other volumes focusing on this issue, this book deals with the implementation of the legislation and the consequences thereof, and is primarily aimed at legal sociologists, sociology of law researchers, criminal lawyers, criminologists with an interest in white collar crime and political scientists studying measures against illicit financial flows and the concrete implementation of anti-money laundering laws. The book will be of interest to both international policymakers and consultants as well as their counterparts in Germany for instance working on improving the instruments to fight organized crime and prevent the financing of terrorism through money laundering. The complexity of the anti-money laundering regime and all the variables are exhaustively and critically reviewed in the assessment, thereby providing complete instructions for future legislative steps. The case study regarding the situation in Germany maximizes readers\' insights into concrete effects of the implementation of international anti-money laundering standards at a national level, and the opinions of professionals work ing in the field and of experts on the law-making process are also illuminating. Moreover, the book equips non-German speakers with the information needed to deal with the extensive German legal scholarly production on article 261 of the German criminal code and the current internal political debate on the matter.

At the time, many were concerned that the Open Government Partnership would end up toothless, offering only lip service to vague ideals and misguided cyber-optimism. The Power of Partnership in Open Government offers a close look, and a surprising affirmation, of the Open Government Partnership as an example of a successful transnational multistakeholder initiative that has indeed impacted policy and helped to produce progressive reform.<br><br>By 2019 the Open Government Partnership had grown to 78 member countries and 20 subnational governments. Through a variety of methods—document analysis, interviews, process tracing, and quantitative analysis of secondary data—Suzanne J. Piotrowski, Daniel Berliner, and Alex Ingrams chart the Open Government Partnership’s effectiveness and evaluate what this reveals about the potential of international reform initiatives in general. Their work calls upon scholars and policymakers to reconsider the role of international institutions and, in doing so, to differentiate between direct and indirect pathways to transnational impact on domestic policy. The more nuanced and complex processes of the indirect pathway, they suggest, have considerable but often overlooked potential to shape policy norms and models, alter resources and opportunities, and forge new linkages and coalitions—in short, to drive the substantial changes that inspire initiatives like the Open Government Partnership.</p>', 'uploads/files/651e1b819746dThe-power-of-partnership-in-open-government-pdf', '2023-10-05 04:12:17', NULL, 1, 1001),

If cruelty can extract secrets that will save lives, so be it. CIA officers and others conducted torture using precisely this justification. But does torture accomplish what its defenders say it does? For ethical reasons, there are no scientific studies of torture. But neuroscientists know a lot about how the brain reacts to fear, extreme temperatures, starvation, thirst, sleep deprivation, and immersion in freezing water, all tools of the torturer’s trade. These stressors create problems for memory, mood, and thinking, and sufferers predictably produce information that is deeply unreliable―and, for intelligence purposes, even counterproductive. As O’Mara guides us through the neuroscience of suffering, he reveals the brain to be much more complex than the brute calculations of torturers have allowed, and he points the way to a humane approach to interrogation, founded in the science of brain and behavior.<br><br>Torture may be effective in forcing confessions, as in Stalin’s Russia. But if we want information that we can depend on to save lives, O’Mara writes, our model should be Napoleon: “It has always been recognized that this way of interrogating men, by putting them to torture, produces nothing worthwhile.”</p>', 'uploads/files/651e346d13683Why-Torture-Doesn’t-Work--The-Neuroscience-of-Interrogation-pdf', '2023-10-05 05:58:37', NULL, 1, 1001),

A less obvious but related problem has been the lack of realistic ethical training material. This author, a 32 year senior financial executive, has adapted the Enron story to address this pressing need. Drawing upon his own experience within a highly disciplined corporate culture, the author has extracted from the wreckage case studies that chart Enron s descent into fraud and ask students to consider how it could have been different. These 17 practical case studies don\'t just retell the Enron story they select pivotal moments when key individuals faced decisions that could carry the firm across another threshold of ethical decomposition. Readers will get the opportunity to stand in the shoes of the young Ken Lay as he pondered how to handle Enron s first trading scandal. They will have the opportunity to consider how to oppose Jeff Skilling s plans to introduce Mark-to-Market accounting and Andy Fastow\'s ever-more aggressive use of Special Purpose Entities . Finally, they will have a chance to reconsider the tactics adopted by those who did resist. For example, was Sherron Watkins right to take her concerns to Ken Lay, or should she have made her case elsewhere? These cases capture the daunting financial complexity that masked Enron\'s problems for years. They are also constructed with an eye on the conflicting business, organizational and personal objectives that complicate real world ethical questions. As each case makes clear, ethics in the business world comes wrapped in practical matters that can make going along seem the smart move. These cases will provide business leaders and students with practice in maintaining their ethical bearings in the face of such complexities and in how to chart a politically viable path of effective resistance. The 17 case studies are augmented by 4 extensive Essays that outline the approach to the cases and also discuss the connection between financial control and a firm s ethical climate. Audience 1). Professionals specializing in audit or financial control advisory work. 2). Business executives at all levels who want to learn about practical business ethics. 3. Students in business ethics. 4.

There\'s little mystery about what good management entails; the biggest mystery is why people are calling this bad behavior \"good enough.\" Today\'s managers work in a success and self-preservation mindset, which doesn\'t always translate to a productive and mission-oriented environment. Too many erroneous assumptions are involved when following the mainstream tenets of work culture, which sap morale, well-being, and performance at both the individual and organizational levels.<br><br>In Good People, Bad Managers: How Work Culture Corrupts Good Intentions, author Samuel A. Culbert makes readers aware of what bad habits are routinely followed by well-intended managers. Managers need to understand the causes for their constant distraction, become more aware of the negatives they inadvertently inflict, and the hollowness of the rationales they use to justify what they do. Company leaders, CEOs, and top tier managers need to become more aware of the ever-present concerns of their own workforce, implementing the management mentality they want in their company and then teaching their managerial employees how to absorb it.<br><br>Culbert offers practical advice for effecting this necessary cultural change in the workplace.

Such technology can be vital in locating clandestine, buried evidence which is often concealed in the subsurface underground. Crime scene investigation and evidence collection entails locating, identifying, collecting, and cataloging. Such physical evidence searches are time consuming and can often lead to searches that require excavations, which in itself that can destroy evidence. The noninvasive, nondestructive methods outlined in this book can both reduce the time spent on searches and excavations, thereby increasing the probability of locating vital physical evidence. As such, the application of remote sensing methods has gained increased acceptance, and seen increased usage, by investigators. Remote sensing methods are based on making indirect measurements of the surface of and within the earth. The resulting measurement information can be presented in either an imaging format— such as in aerial photography—or a non-imaging format, such as in a profile or contour map. These measurements can be interpreted to identify and characterize contrasts due to differences in physical and natural properties of the materials being studied. This can include physical evidence, remains, and clandestine graves. This book will serve as a handy introductory primer to the technology, techniques, and application of such techniques. Throughout, numerous references and additional resources are provided for those investigators, forensic anthropology, and police professionals who want further information on the technology’s usage for investigative purposes.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Half Title</li><li>Title Page</li><li>Copyright Page</li><li>Table of Contents</li><li>List of Figures and Tables</li><li>Foreword</li><li>A Caution</li><li>Acknowledgments</li><li>About the Author</li><li>1 Introduction</li><li>1.1 Historical Background</li><li>1.2 General Methodology</li><li>1.3 Need for High-Resolution Geophysical Capabilities</li><li>1.4 Site Survey Grid</li><li>2 Overview of Modern Geophysical Methods</li><li>2.1 Passive Geophysical Methods</li><li>2.1.1 Magnetics</li><li>2.1.2 Self-Potential</li><li>2.1.3 Gravity</li><li>2.1.4 Thermal Imaging</li><li>2.2 Active Geophysical Methods</li><li>2.2.1 Electromagnetics</li><li>2.2.2 Ground-Penetrating Radar</li><li>2.2.3 Electrical Resistivity</li><li>2.2.4 Acoustic (Seismic and Sonar)</li><li>3 Presurvey Planning and Postsurvey Reporting Requirements</li><li>3.1 Overall Statement of Objectives</li><li>3.2 Formulation of the Survey Plan: Questionnaire</li><li>3.3 Presurvey Site Evaluation</li><li>3.4 Equipment</li><li>3.5 Personnel</li><li>3.6 Reporting</li><li>4 Magnetic Surveying</li><li>4.1 Introduction</li><li>4.2 Limitations</li><li>4.3 Instrumentation</li><li>4.3.1 Total Field Magnetometers</li><li>4.3.2 Gradient Magnetometers</li><li>4.4 Field Procedures</li><li>4.5 Special Considerations</li><li>4.6 Documentation</li><li>4.7 Data Reduction</li><li>4.8 Data Interpretation</li><li>4.9 Data Presentation</li><li>4.10 Summary</li><li>5 Electromagnetic Surveying</li><li>5.1 Introduction</li><li>5.2 Limitations</li><li>5.3 Instrumentation</li><li>5.4 Field Procedures</li><li>5.5 Special Considerations</li><li>5.6 Documentation</li><li>5.7 Data Reduction</li><li>5.8 Data Interpretation</li><li>5.9 Data Presentation</li><li>5.10 Summary</li><li>6 Ground-Penetrating Radar Surveying</li><li>6.1 Introduction</li><li>6.2 Limitations</li><li>6.3 Instrumentation</li><li>6.4 Field Procedures</li><li>6.5 Special Considerations</li><li>6.6 Documentation</li><li>6.7 Data Reduction</li><li>6.8 Data Interpretation</li><li>6.9 Data Presentation</li><li>6.10 Summary</li><li>6.11 Words for a Warrant to Utilize GPR</li><li>6.11.1 Advantages</li><li>6.11.2 Disadvantages</li><li>6.11.3 Precedents</li><li>7 Metal Detector Surveying</li><li>7.1 Introduction</li><li>7.2 Limitations</li><li>7.3 Instrumentation</li><li>7.4 Field Procedures</li><li>7.5 Special Considerations</li><li>7.6 Summary</li><li>8 Infrared</li><li>8.1 Introduction</li><li>8.2 Limitations</li><li>8.3 Instrumentation</li><li>8.4 Documentation</li><li>8.5 Data Processing</li><li>8.6 False-Color Infrared</li><li>8.7 Summary</li><li>9 Marine Geophysical Methods</li><li>9.1 Acoustic Methods</li><li>9.2 Magnetic Methods</li><li>9.3 Ground-Penetrating Radar</li><li>9.4 Special Considerations</li><li>10 Airborne Geophysical Methods</li><li>11 Quality Control</li><li>11.1 Records</li><li>11.1.1 Field Activity Records</li><li>11.1.2 Equipment Use Log</li><li>11.2 Original Data Sets</li><li>11.3 Data Storage</li><li>12 Concluding Remarks</li><li>Glossary</li><li>Selected References</li><li>Index</li></ol>', 'uploads/files/651e62d433620Remote-sensing-technology-in-forensic-investigations-geophysical-techniques-to-locate-clandestine-graves-and-hidden-evidence-pdf', '2023-10-05 09:16:36', NULL, 1, 1001),

Through analyses of theoretical propositions of disability in South Asia and empirical explorations of the lives of persons with disabilities in India, this book not only brings to the forefront a hitherto unexplored realm in academic discourse, but also bridges the gap between theory and lived reality, and between policy and practice. Thus, it is an important addition to the field of development studies in South Asia. The papers herein represent multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives from architects, lawyers, sociologists, political scientists, historians, economists and linguists to social work practitioners from the grassroots level. This range of insights from different disciplines allows for the exploration of a wide range of issues around disability and the lives of disabled people, moving from theoretical assumptions to exploring structural and infrastructural barriers, to problematizing different aspects of the lives of disabled people, and from objective realms to more subjective domains. Along with students and researchers of disability studies, this book is of interest to a diverse readership encompassing the social sciences, mental health, and development studies.</p><p>Table of

The chapters build on the Hintikkan tradition extending Hintikka’s model and present a wide variety of approaches to the philosophy of inquiry from different directions, ranging from erotetic logic to Lakatosian philosophy, from socio-epistemologic approaches to strategic reasoning and mathematical practice. Hintikka\'s theory of inquiry is a well-known example of a dynamic epistemic procedure. In an interrogative inquiry, the inquirer is given a theory and a question. He then tries to answer the question based on the theory by posing questions to nature or an oracle. The initial formulation of this procedure by Hintikka is rather broad and informal. This volume introduces a carefully selected responses to the issues discussed by Hintikka. The articles in the volume were contributed by various authors associated with a research project on Hintikka\'s interrogative theory of inquiry conducted in the Institut d’Histoire et de Philosophie des Sciences et des Techniques (IHPST) of Paris, including those who visited to share their insight.</p><p>Table of Content:</p><ol><li>Preface</li><li>Contents</li><li>Inquiry and

But surveillance is not only \'done to us\' - it is something we do in everyday life. We submit to surveillance, believing we have nothing to hide. Or we try to protect our privacy or negotiate the terms under which others have access to our data. At the same time, we participate in surveillance in order to supervise children, monitor other road users, and safeguard our property. Social media allow us to keep tabs on others, as well as on ourselves. This is the culture of surveillance.<br><br>This important book explores the imaginaries and practices of everyday surveillance. Its main focus is not high-tech, organized surveillance operations but our varied, mundane experiences of surveillance that range from the casual and careless to the focused and intentional. It insists that it is time to stop using Orwellian metaphors and find ones suited to twenty-first-century surveillance -- from \'The Circle\' or \'Black Mirror.\'&nbsp;<br><br>Surveillance culture, David Lyon argues, is not detached from the surveillance state, society and economy. It is informed by them.

According to international standards, every bank has the obligation to know its customers and to report suspicious transactions. Although these obligations sound straightforward, they have proved challenging to implement. What information precisely has to be gathered? How should it be recorded? If and when does one have to file a suspicious transaction report? It is here that a supervisor can play a crucial role in helping supervised institutions; first, in understanding the full extent of the obligations of Customer Due Diligence and Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) and, second, in ensuring that those obligations are not just words on paper but are applied in practice. Effective supervision is key to the success of a country s AML/CFT system. In this regard, field work in both developed and developing countries has shown an overall low compliance in the area of supervision of banks and other financial institutions; supervisory compliance is indeed generally lower than the average level of compliance with all Financial Action Task Force recommendations. As a result, by providing examples of good practices, this book aims to help countries better conform to international standards. In this regard, this handbook is specifically designed for bank supervisors.</p>', 'uploads/files/6523738b434acPreventing-Money-Laundering-and-Terrorist-Financing--1--pdf', '2023-10-09 05:29:15', NULL, 1, 1001);

Unfortunately, in most countries investigators, prosecutors, judges, and regulatory agencies are not equipped to accurately detect, investigate and prosecute this type of criminal activity. Also, regulation and international laws and treaties involving the art world have many loopholes that can potentially lead to the laundering of large sums of money. This book provides a bird’s eye view of novel ways in which money laundering happens through illegal activities involving art. It can serve as a guide for law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and others involved in efforts to curb money laundering and financing of terrorism, revealing why somehow new techniques used by criminals have been neglected by law enforcement in most countries. Drawing from his own experience with the matter in both Brazil and in the United States, the author makes a case for broader institutional and regulatory improvement, extending beyond mere regulation of the art market.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Frontmatter</li><li>1.

In addition, it explores the new standards of surveillance using unmanned air vehicles and drones, proposes surveillance techniques for detecting stealth aircrafts and drones, and highlights key techniques for maritime border surveillance, bio-warfare and bio-terrorism detection.</p><p>The last part of the book, Cyber Surveillance, provides a review of data hiding techniques that are used to hinder electronic surveillance. It subsequently presents methods for collecting and analyzing information from social media sites and discusses techniques for detecting internal and external threats posed by various individuals (such as spammers, cyber-criminals, suspicious users or extremists in general). The book concludes by examining how high-performance computing environments can be exploited by malicious users, and what surveillance methods need to be put in place to protect these valuable infrastructures.&nbsp;</p><p>The book is primarily intended for military and law enforcement personnel who use surveillance-related technologies, as well as researchers, Master’s and Ph.D. students who are interested in learning about the latest advances in military, civilian and cyber surveillance.</p><p>Table of Content

As first lady of the United States of America - the first African American to serve in that role - she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the US and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.</p><p>In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites listeners into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her - from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work to her time spent at the world\'s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it - in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations - and whose story inspires us to do the same.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Title Page</li><li>Copyright</li><li>Dedication</li><li>Contents</li><li>Endpaper Photographs</li><li>Introduction to the Paperback Edition</li><li>Preface</li><li>Becoming Me</li><li>Chapter 1</li><li>Chapter 2</li><li>Chapter 3</li><li>Chapter 4</li><li>Chapter 5</li><li>Chapter 6</li><li>Chapter 7</li><li>Chapter 8</li><li>Becoming Us</li><li>Chapter 9</li><li>Chapter 10</li><li>Chapter 11</li><li>Chapter 12</li><li>Chapter 13</li><li>Chapter 14</li><li>Chapter 15</li><li>Chapter 16</li><li>Chapter 17</li><li>Chapter 18</li><li>Becoming More</li><li>Chapter 19</li><li>Chapter 20</li><li>Chapter 21</li><li>Chapter 22</li><li>Chapter 23</li><li>Chapter 24</li><li>Epilogue</li><li>Photograph Insert</li><li>Note to Self</li><li>Acknowledgments</li><li>Photograph Credits</li><li>Reader’s Discussion Guide</li><li>A Conversation with Michelle Obama</li></ol>', 'uploads/files/6523a88985731Becoming-By-Michelle-Obama-pdf', '2023-10-09 09:15:21', NULL, 1, 1001),

Anti-corruption is one of the preeminent issues in the modern global commercial order and is tackled with the help of criminal law and contract law in different ways in different countries. The reports included in this volume, from very diverse parts of the world, represent a unique and rich compilation of court decisions, doctrinal discussions and a pool of suggested solutions. The central theme is the enforceability of three problematic types of contracts: the bribe agreement, whereby a bribe payer promises the agent of his business partner a personal benefit in exchange for favourable contract terms; the agreement between a bribe payer and an intermediary (a “bribe merchant”), where the latter offers his expertise to help funnel bribes to agents of the business partner; and finally, the contract between the bribe payer and his business partner which was obtained by means of bribery. The analysis is tailored toward commercial contracts, which can also include contracts with state-owned enterprises. The examination and comparison of international and national initiatives included in this volume advance the discussion on the most appropriate remedies in corruption cases, and show how to get past the boundaries of criminal, private and contract law.</p><ol><li>Table of Content :</li><li>Preface&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;About the Authors&nbsp;</li></ol><ul><li>The Impact of Corruption on International Commercial Contracts General Report &nbsp;Michael Joachim Bonell and Olaf Meyer.</li><li>II.

Each in their own way, and at the same time similar patterns emerge.</p><p>Are you ready to stop procrastinating, or being stressed out and swamped? Do you want to get more done, day in day out – and be relaxed at the same time? And are you prepared to take a good look at yourself, too? Then this is the e-book for you!</p><p>This e-book is more than about Time Management, it’s also about Self Management and Energy Management.</p><p>Time Management is about the HOW: which techniques and systems can I use to free up as much time as possible? There are all kinds of systems around, that all have their merits and pitfalls.</p><p>Because we’re all different, one single approach can’t possibly work for everyone. Many Time Management systems are definitely useful, but fail because of personal reasons. If you want to learn to manage your time more efficiently and become more productive, you need to know yourself and what works for you (Self Management). You need to know where you’re losing your energy and will power, and how to build it up as much as possible (energy management).</p><p>This e-book will do just that: give you some insights into your specific time management personality and offer you options that you can turn into new habits and systems.</p><p>What you’ll learn in this Time Management Course</p><ul><li>How you can have more energy to get things done.</li><li>Techniques and insights to keep your focus and will power strong.</li><li>Prioritizing, short and long term.</li><li>Dealing with external deadlines and expectations.</li><li>Email, task and project management.</li><li>Creating a unified system to process all incoming into one flow.</li><li>Tips &amp; Tricks on productivity and beating procrastination.</li><li>An overview of the best Time Management Systems around.</li></ul><p>Table of Content:</p><ol><li>Where are you losing time?</li><li>If only it were this simple...<ol><li>The Golden Rule</li></ol></li><li>Time Management = Self Management<ol><li>Building your own Time Management Style</li><li>What type of Time Manager are you?</li></ol></li><li>The enemy of Productivity: Procrastination<ol><li>Reasons we procrastinate</li><li>Some starter tips to tackle procrastination</li></ol></li><li>It’s all about energy and will power<ol><li>Ways to build energy &amp; will power</li><li>Ways to conserve energy</li><li>11 More Ways to Improve Productivity</li><li>EXTRA – What’s the best work music?</li></ol></li><li>How To Set Priorities<ol><li>Stephen Covey’s Time Management Grid</li></ol></li><li>A few Time Management Systems in short<ol><li>Benjamin Ball’s Master Daily Calendar system</li><li>The Pomodoro System</li><li>Chet Holmes</li><li>David Allen’s ‘Getting Things Done’</li></ol></li><li>Specific Areas of Time Management<ol><li>How To Manage E-mail Overload In 3 Easy Steps</li><li>Telecommuting: How To Increase Productivity From Home</li></ol></li></ol>', 'uploads/files/65262c17c9732time-of-your-life-pdf', '2023-10-11 07:01:11', NULL, 1, 1001),

The book also explores the compatibility between the legal framework implemented by the Bank and the rule of law, the role of precedents, and the level of due process. It highlights the fact that the sanctions system is currently characterized by a lack of legal guarantees, and that there are compelling reasons for supporting the argument that due process safeguards should be applied to it in their entirety. To that end, the book conducts a thorough analysis of&nbsp;specific procedural aspects such as the right to a hearing, the right to evidence disclosure, the time limit regime, the standard of proof and shift of the burden of proof, the evidential value of a party’s silence, and the consistency and predictability of the World Bank’s sentencing practice.&nbsp;The study is conducted on the basis of a detailed and painstaking examination of the most relevant decisions taken by the Sanctions Board, providing the first-ever commentary on&nbsp;the World Bank’s case law.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><ul><li>The World Bank Sanctions System: Historical Overview and Background</li><li>The Evolution of the World Bank Sanctions System</li><li>Framing the World Bank’s Sanction Power: Sources and Procedure</li><li>Respondents, Sanctionable Practices, and Attribution of Liability</li><li>Defense’s Rights and Rule of Evidence</li><li>Sanctions and Sentencing Practices</li><li>Back Matter</li></ul>', 'uploads/files/6528bfd7cddf0Fighting-Fraud-and-Corruption-at-the-World-Bank---PDFDrive---pdf', '2023-10-13 05:56:07', NULL, 1, 1001),

It focuses on historical context and cultural factors. Readers will learn that though corruption is pervasive, geography greatly shapes its character. This book will offer a better understanding of the level of corrupt activity in any given country.The book analyzes an array of countries and regions. Coverage ranges from democratic societies, where corruption is low due to high rates of literacy and a free press, to the most corrupt places, where centralized power structures and lack of a free media allow corruption to unfold unimpeded. Anti-corruption campaigns and their effectiveness are also reflected upon. In addition to data from Transparency International, the text examines relevant political events. In each case, the analysis focuses on the major actors and institutions involved; the cultural norms that often regard corruption as a normal part of doing business; and the attempts by foreign and domestic actors to minimize corruption. This book will help readers better understand the causes and consequences of corruption, as well as its type and severity varies widely across the planet. It will appeal to students, researchers, policy makers, and interested general readers.</p><p>Table of Content:</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Front Matter</li><li>1.&nbsp;Introduction</li><li>2.&nbsp;Geographies of Latin American Corruption</li><li>3.&nbsp;European Corruption in Geographic Perspective</li><li>4.&nbsp;Spatiality of Corruption in the Middle East and North Africa</li><li>5.&nbsp;Geographies of Sub-Saharan African Corruption</li><li>6.&nbsp;Geographically Uneven Landscapes of Asian Corruption</li><li>7.&nbsp;Corruption in Oceania</li><li>8.&nbsp;Corruption in the United States and Canada</li><li>9.&nbsp;Conclusions</li><li>Back Matter</li></ol>', 'uploads/files/6528c0e596547Global-Corruption-from-a-Geographic-Perspective---PDFDrive---pdf', '2023-10-13 06:00:37', NULL, 1, 1001),

The theory suggests a multilevel analysis that tests hypotheses regarding the relations of journalism and corruption within each level and across levels in international comparative research designs. Corruption as the abuse of power for private gain is built into the journalistic, economic, political, and cultural structures of any society and is affected by its interaction within the international system. The important questions of how differences in corruption across countries can be explained or what makes it more or less in a particular society and how press freedom and social media contribute to the fight against corruption are still unanswered. This book represents a significant contribution on the way to answer these critical questions. It discusses a variety of journalism-corruption experiences that provide a wealth of results and analyses. The cases it examines extend from Cuba to Algeria, India, Saudi Arabia, Sub-Saharan African, Gulf Cooperation Countries, Arab World, and Japan. The primary contribution of this book is both theoretical and empirical.

Yet over and over again they found a significant percentage are able to overcome their life circumstances and achieve spectacular success. &nbsp; How is it that individuals who are not “supposed” to succeed manage to overcome the odds? Are there certain traits that such people have in common? Can the rest of us learn from their success and apply it to our own lives? &nbsp; In Succeeding When You’re Supposed to Fail, Rom Brafman, psychologist and coauthor of the bestselling book Sway, set out to answer these questions. In a riveting narrative that interweaves compelling stories from education, the military, and business and a wide range of groundbreaking new research, Brafman identifies the six hidden drivers behind unlikely success. Among them: &nbsp; •The critical importance of the Limelight Effect—our ability to redirect the focus of our lives to the result of our own efforts, as opposed to external forces •The value of a satellite in our lives—the remarkable way in which a consistent ally who accepts us unconditionally while still challenging us to be our best can make a huge difference •The power of temperament—people who are able to tunnel through life’s obstacles have a surprisingly mild disposition; they don’t allow the bumps in the road to unsettle them &nbsp; By understanding and incorporating these strategies in our own lives, Brafman argues, we can all be better prepared to overcome the inevitable obstacles we face, from setbacks at work to challenges in our personal lives.</p><p>Table of Contents:</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Title Page</li><li>Copyright</li><li>Dedication</li><li>Contents</li><li>Prologue</li><li>1.

Anti-corruption is not an issue that concerns only the judiciary branch, the legal system, and police authorities, but it is, above all, a challenge for society and institutions as a whole. And it is a challenge to be transformed, in particular, into a change in administrations and institutions, in their way of organizing and operating. This volume the result of the Project “Administrative Prevention through Targeted Anti-corruption MODels for candidate countries” – APTAMOD, co-funded by the European Union’s HERCULE III programme, which has conducted comparative law studies and high-profile research activities in the field of administrative prevention of corruption, with specific focus on Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia</p>', 'uploads/files/655434f6b24aaanti-corruption-model-pdf', '2023-11-15 04:03:18', NULL, 1, 1001),

These are analyzed through an ecosystem framework in which, similar to a natural ecosystem, new tax regulations appear as heavy shocks to the tax ecosystem, to which the \'species\' such as countries, corporations, and tax experts will react by looking for new loopholes and niches of survival. By analyzing the impact of tax reforms from different perspectives—a legal, political science, accounting, and economic one—one may derive an assessment of the reforms and policy recommendations for an improved international tax system.<br><br>The ultimate goal is to combat fiscal fraud and empower regulators, in that line, this volume is intended for a broad audience that seeks to know more about the latest state of the art in the realm of taxation from a multidisciplinary perspective. The money involved amounts to billions in unpaid taxes that could be better used for stopping hunger, guaranteeing education, and safeguarding biodiversity, hence making this world a better one. Regulators can see this book as a guiding light of what has happened in the past forty years, and how the world has and will continue to change as a result of it. <i>Combating Fiscal Fraud and Empowering Regulators</i> is also a warning about new emerging tax loopholes, such as freeports or golden passports and visas, where residency can be bought in tax havens, even within the European Union. The main message is that inequality can and has to be reduced substantially and that this can be achieved through a well-working international tax system that eliminates secrecy, opaqueness, and tax havens.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><p>Foreword<br>Preface<br>Acknowledgements<br>Contents<br>List of Figures<br>List of Tables<br>List of Abbreviations<br>List of Contributors<br>1:Introduction to Combating Fiscal Fraud and Empowering Regulators<br>2:Actors and Authority in the International Tax Ecosystem<br>3:Sophisticated Financial Engineering and Tax arbitrage<br>4:Reappraising the Tax Gap<br>5:How Big are Illicit Financial Flows?

The contributions to this volume challenge this conventional wisdom by considering how relations of trust and policies of transparency are modulated by underlying power asymmetries, sociohistorical legacies, economic structures, and institutional constraints. They study trust and transparency as embedded in specific sociopolitical contexts to show how, under certain conditions, transparency can become a tool of social control that erodes trust, while mistrust—rather than trust—can sometimes offer the most promising approach to safeguarding rights and freedom in an age of surveillance.</p><p>The first book addressing the interrelationship of trust, transparency, and surveillance practices, this volume will be of interest to scholars and students of surveillance studies as well as appeal to an interdisciplinary audience given the contributions from political science, sociology, philosophy, law, and civil society.

You’ll then dive deep into core Kubernetes concepts, learning Kubernetes architecture, Kubernetes objects and workload resources, and how to exploit them to their full potential. You’ll also learn Kubernetes deployment strategies and concepts related to rollout and rollback. Moving on, you’ll look at two very important aspects of any computing ecosystem: networking and storage. You will gain an understanding of access control in Kubernetes and how to manage a Kubernetes cluster using probes, resource quotas, taints, and tolerations. You will also get an overview of Docker and review Docker and Kubernetes best practices. Finally, you will learn about the kubectl command line tool. What You Will Learn Learn about basic and advanced Kubernetes objects and workload resources Master important concepts such as namespaces, selectors, annotations, and access control Understand the Kubernetes networking and storage system Manage a Kubernetes cluster with the help of probes, resource quotas, limits, and taints Who&nbsp;This Book Is For Application developers and technical managers—both on the development and support sides, beginner and intermediate Kubernetes practitioners and aspirants, and those preparing for Kubernetes interviews.</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Front Matter</li><li>1.&nbsp;Welcome to The World of Containers!</li><li>2.&nbsp;Kubernetes Deep Dive</li><li>3.&nbsp;Fundamental Objects in Kubernetes Clusters</li><li>4.&nbsp;Advanced Objects In Kubernetes Clusters</li><li>5.&nbsp;Objects Important For A Secure Kubernetes Cluster</li><li>6.&nbsp;Networking in Kubernetes</li><li>7.&nbsp;Kubernetes Storage System</li><li>8.&nbsp;Manage Your Kubernetes Cluster Efficiently</li><li>9.&nbsp;Docker Overview And Kubernetes Best Practices</li><li>10.&nbsp;kubectl: The Command-Line Tool</li><li>Back Matter</li></ol>', 'uploads/files/656d29964c40a-OceanofPDF-com-Kubernetes-Fundamentals---Himanshu-Agrawal-pdf', '2023-12-04 02:21:26', NULL, 1, 1001),

Are there aspects about the process that are hiding beneath the surface, unknown to even experienced negotiators? Or insider tools that would change your game considerably? The answer is yes—and they’re all revealed in this practical guide from a world-renowned negotiation expert. Negotiation Essentials demystifies this all-important subject, helping you break the process down into easily digestible parts. It covers the most important negotiating concepts, including the critical differences among great, good, and bad negotiators; choosing when, where, and how to negotiate; the art of saying no; understanding body language; how emotions, stress, and personal chemistry affect decision making; and behavioral patterns of the most successful negotiators. Negotiation Essentials is organized into three thematic sections: PART I: THE ESSENTIALS explains how to identify a negotiation, how to know who is winning, the important role preparation plays, creating a winning negotiating strategy, and more. PART II: THE ESSENTIALS APPLIED starts with an assessment to see which areas of negotiation you need to focus on, then teaches the 10 phrases in a successful negotiation, 5 different negotiation styles and how to use them, and so much more. PART III: BEYOND THE ESSENTIALS, dives into negotiating across cultures, the roles that emotions, stress, personal chemistry, and trust play in negotiations, the difference between face-to-face and online negotiations, and secrets of the award-winning Negotiation Economics philosophy—opening the possibility of achieving up to 42% unrealized value. Filled with essential takeaways wrapping up each chapter, assessments, illustrations, color illustrations, and clear action steps, Negotiation Essentials concludes with a Negotiating Essentials Toolkit, which includes the professional negotiators pre- and post-negotiation checklists. Whether you’re discussing a possible promotion with a supervisor, speaking to a potential high-dollar client, or engaging in a merger and acquisition process, knowing how to plan and conduct a successful negotiation is what will spell the difference between success and failure.</p><p>Table of Content :</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Title Page</li><li>Copyright Page</li><li>Dedication</li><li>Contents</li><li>Acknowledgments</li><li>Introduction: What Is a Negotiation?</li><li>PART I THE ESSENTIALS</li><li>1 What Makes a Great Negotiator?</li><li>2 The Importance of Trust in Negotiation</li><li>3 How to Tell if You’re Losing a Negotiation—and Win It Back</li><li>4 Mastering Virtual Negotiations</li><li>5 Conducting Negotiations Abroad</li><li>PART II THE ESSENTIALS APPLIED</li><li>Negotiation Competence Self-Assessment</li><li>6 The Phases of Negotiation: Prenegotiation</li><li>7 The Phases of Negotiation: Negotiation</li><li>8 The Phases of Negotiation: Postnegotiation</li><li>9 The Five Styles of Negotiation</li><li>PART III BEYOND THE ESSENTIALS</li><li>10 The Principles of NegoEconomics</li><li>11 How to Negotiate Effectively Using NegoEconomics</li><li>12 NegoEconomics in Action</li><li>13 The Ongoing Journey of Negotiation</li><li>Negotiation Essentials Toolkit</li><li>Notes</li><li>Index</li><li>About the Author</li></ol>', 'uploads/files/656d2ed9d7c36-OceanofPDF-com-Negotiation-Essentials---Keld-Jensene-pdf', '2023-12-04 02:43:53', NULL, 1, 1001),

The postcolonial Indian police have often been accused of using torture in both routine and exceptional criminal cases, but they, and forensic psychologists, have claimed that lie detectors, brain scans, and narcoanalysis (the use of “truth serum,” Sodium Pentothal) represent a paradigm shift away from physical torture; most state high courts in India have upheld this rationale.<br>The Truth Machines examines the emergence and use of these three scientific techniques to analyze two primary themes. First, the book questions whether existing theoretical frameworks for understanding state power and legal violence are adequate to explain constant innovations of the state. Second, it explores the workings of law, science, and policing in the everyday context to generate a theory of state power and legal violence, challenging the monolithic frameworks about this relationship, based on a study of both state and non-state actors.</p><p><br>Jinee Lokaneeta argues that the attempt to replace physical torture with truth machines in India fails because it relies on a confessional paradigm that is contiguous with torture. Her work also provides insights into a police institution that is founded and refounded in its everyday interactions between state and non-state actors. Theorizing a concept of Contingent State, this book demonstrates the disaggregated, and decentered nature of state power and legal violence, creating possible sites of critique and intervention.</p>', 'uploads/files/656d44ce4c7e9-OceanofPDF-com-The-Truth-Machines---Jinee-Lokaneeta-pdf', '2023-12-04 04:17:34', NULL, 1, 1001),

McCoy uncovers the deep, disturbing roots of recent scandals at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo. Far from aberrations, as the White House has claimed, <i>A Question of Torture</i> shows that these abuses are the product of a long-standing covert program of interrogation.<br>Developed at the cost of billions of dollars, the CIA\'s method combined \"sensory deprivation\" and \"self-inflicted pain\" to create a revolutionary psychological approach—the first innovation in torture in centuries. The simple techniques—involving isolation, hooding, hours of standing, extremes of hot and cold, and manipulation of time—constitute an all-out assault on the victim\'s senses, destroying the basis of personal identity. McCoy follows the years of research—which, he reveals, compromised universities and the U.S. Army—and the method\'s dissemination, from Vietnam through Iran to Central America. He traces how after 9/11 torture became Washington\'s weapon of choice in both the CIA\'s global prisons and in \"torture-friendly\" countries to which detainees are dispatched. Finally McCoy argues that information extracted by coercion is worthless, making a case for the legal approach favored by the FBI.<br>Scrupulously documented and grippingly told, <i>A Question of Torture</i> is a devastating indictment of inhumane practices that have spread throughout the intelligence system, damaging American\'s laws, military, and international standing.</p><p>Table of Content:</p><ol><li>Cover</li><li>Halftitle</li><li>Title</li><li>Copyright</li><li>Dedication</li><li>Contents</li><li>Introduction</li><li>1.

Or does it undermine democratic rule and worsen the perennial problems of poverty and inequality. Do citizens condemn, condone, or simply acquiesce to the corrupt behavior of their politicians? Corruption and Politics in Latin America addresses these thorny questions, offering a fresh and timely approach to the subject. The authors\' systematic comparative analysis of six countries—Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela—focuses on patterns and underlying causes of corruption, the impact of political and economic changes, the effect of corruption on politics and society, and the nature and effectiveness of recent reforms. There is also a chapter devoted to regional and international efforts to attack corruption. With a common analytical approach reflected throughout, the book is both an accessible introduction and a source of new and provocative information and analysis</p>', 'uploads/files/656d7fde689ef-OceanofPDF-com-Corruption-and-Politics-in-Latin-America---Stephen-D-Morris-pdf', '2023-12-04 08:29:34', NULL, 1, 1001),

But when her investigations questioned whether the use of animal tissue in medical research were unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases, such as autism and chronic fatigue syndrome,&nbsp;she saw science at its worst.

Now Enrich turns his eye towards the world of “Big Law” and the nearly unchecked influence these firms wield to shield the wealthy and powerful—and bury their secrets. To tell this story, Enrich focuses on Jones Day, one of the world’s largest law firms. Jones Day’s narrative arc—founded in Cleveland in 1893, it became the first law firm to expand nationally and is now a global juggernaut with deep ties to corporate interests and conservative politics—is a powerful encapsulation of the changes that have swept the legal industry in recent decades.</p><p>Since 2016, Jones Day has been in the spotlight for representing Donald Trump and his campaigns (and now his PACs)—and for the fleet of Jones Day attorneys who joined his administration, including White House Counsel Don McGahn. Jones Day helped Trump fend off the Mueller investigation and challenged Obamacare. Its once and future lawyers defended Trump’s Muslim ban and border policies and handled his judicial nominations. Jones Day even laid some of the legal groundwork for Trump to challenge the legitimacy of the 2020 election.</p><p>But the Trump work is but one chapter in the firm’s checkered history. Jones Day, like many of its peers, have become highly effective enablers of the business world’s worst misbehavior. The firm has for decades represented Big Tobacco in its fight to avoid liability for its products. Jones Day worked tirelessly for the Catholic Church as it tried to minimize its sexual-abuse scandals. And for Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, as it sought to protect its right to make and market its dangerously addictive drug. And for Fox News as it waged war against employees who were the victims of sexual harassment and retaliation. And for Russian oligarchs as their companies sought to expand internationally.</p><p>In this gripping and revealing new work of narrative nonfiction, Enrich makes the compelling central argument that law firms like Jones Day play a crucial yet largely hidden role in enabling and protecting powerful bad actors in our society, housing their darkest secrets, and earning billions in revenue for themselves.</p>', 'uploads/files/656d835ce0192-OceanofPDF-com-Servants-of-the-Damned---David-Enrich-pdf', '2023-12-04 08:44:28', NULL, 1, 1001),

The book also discusses how legal justice can be realized and how victims\' rights can be protected. It looks at epidemiological evidence pertaining to causal relationships in cases such as smoking and the development of lung cancer, and enables readers to correctly interpret and rationally use the results of epidemiological studies in lawsuits. The book argues that in today\'s risk society, it is no longer possible to thwart the competence of evidence using epidemiological research results. In particular, it points out that the number of cases that struggle to prove a causal relationship excluding those using epidemiological data will lead to an increase in the number of lawsuits for damages that arise as a result of harmful materials that affect our health. The book argues that the responsibility to compensate for damages that have actually occurred must be imputed to a particular party and that this can be achieved by understanding causal inferences between jurisprudence and epidemiology. This book serves as a foundation for students, academics and researchers who have an interest in epidemiology and the law, and those who are keen to discover how jurisprudence can bring these two areas together.</li></ul><p>Table of Content:</p><ul><li>1.

It provides an opportunity to answer tough questions of yourself, process your own life lessons, reflect on your unique experiences, and create your best future self. This process of self-discovery will help you develop individualized, customized wisdom and be your lifelong companion on the road to being wiser, younger.<br><br>Now revised, with the addition of Learning Modules for each chapter, Choosing Leadership provides step-by-step guidance to create group experiences designed to enable reflection, explore ideas, and enhance self-understanding. These group experiences create collective wisdom and encourage learners to make better and more thoughtful choices. Through peer discussions, readers learn how to coach themselves.

This book critiques the reliance of Western intelligence agencies on the use of a method for intelligence analysis developed by the CIA in the 1990s, the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH). The author puts ACH to the test in an experimental setting against two key cognitive biases with unique empirical research facilitated by UK’s Professional Heads of Intelligence Analysis unit at the Cabinet Office, and finds that the theoretical basis of the ACH method is significantly flawed. Combining the insight of a practitioner with over 11 years of experience in intelligence with both philosophical theory and experimental research, the author proposes an alternative approach to mitigating cognitive bias that focuses on creating the optimum environment for analysis, challenging current leading theories.</p>', 'uploads/files/6579262a27ca7-OceanofPDF-com-Cognitive-Bias-in-Intelligence-Analysis---Martha-Whitesmith-pdf', '2023-12-13 04:34:02', NULL, 1, 1001),

They also consider the effect of the focus in early ICTY and ICTR proceedings on relatively low-level accused for the development of legal definitions that are sometimes ill-suited for leadership cases, where the accused had little or no physical involvement in the crimes. The book\'s main focus is the jurisprudence of the ad hoc Tribunals, but the approaches of the ICC and the various hybrid tribunals are also given significant attention. The relevant jurisprudence up to 1 December 2007 has been surveyed, making this a highly useful and timely work.</p>', 'uploads/files/65a0a5670d6a5635a6cba8cc29-international-criminal-law-practitioner-library-pdf', '2024-01-12 03:35:19', NULL, 1, 1001),

Additionally, exchange rate volatility can determine the amount of exchange rate risk that firms can be opposed to; therefore, exchange rate volatility is a crucial issue that should be monitored by central banks to prevent contagion of negative microeconomic developments to macroeconomic activity and stability.

Choi-Fitzpatrick analyzes the way small-scale drones—as well as satellites, kites, and balloons—are used for a great many things, including documenting human rights abuses, estimating demonstration crowd size, supporting anti-poaching advocacy, and advancing climate change research. In fact, he finds, small drones are used disproportionately for good; nonviolent prosocial uses predominate.</p><p>Choi-Fitzpatrick\'s broader point is that the use of technology by social movements goes beyond social media—and began before social media. From the barricades in Les Misérables to hacking attacks on corporate servers to the spread of the #MeToo hashtag on Twitter, technology is used to raise awareness, but is also crucial in raising the cost of the status quo.</p><p>New technology in the air changes politics on the ground, and raises provocative questions along the way. What is the nature and future of the camera, when it is taken out of human hands? How will our ideas about privacy evolve when the altitude of a penthouse suite no longer guarantees it?
